##NOTE: Any output from the computer will be put as ##>
## the basic codes required to build a working search engine are as follow:
############PRINT <result> - tells the computer to output(print) result, result can be anything, string/number etc.
## for example:
print "string"
##>string
print 5*2
##>10
x="test"
print x
##>test

############REFERENCING - require to determine what information we need.
## referencing can be used for both string and list. To do this, you need to use variable[<start>:<end>], for example:
a = "test_string"
